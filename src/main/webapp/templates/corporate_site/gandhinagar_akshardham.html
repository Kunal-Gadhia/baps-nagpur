        <p class="para text-justify">
            At the center of the spacious Akshardham complex, a delicate and beautiful architectural masterpiece - the Akshardham Monument - enshrines the golden murti (idol) of Lord Swaminarayan, the founder of the Swaminarayan Faith.

            Akshardham Monument

            The imposing 10 story high monument is made entirely of intricately carved, 6000 tons of pink sand-stone from Rajasthan, with no steel or cement used at all, ensuring that the monument will last for a thousand years. It is 108 ft.(32.92 m) tall, 240 ft.(73.15 m) long and 131 ft.(39.93 m) wide.

            Designed and crafted according to ancient Indian Architectural Treatises (called the Sthaapatya shastras), the monument radiates a spiritual aura into the complex. The monument is awash with silence and peace, which one spontaneously experiences in the three floors -

            Hari Mandapam (the main floor), 
            Vibhuti Mandapam (the upper floor), 
            Prasadi Mandapam (the ground floor).
